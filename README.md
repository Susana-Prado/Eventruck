## Description

This website allows users to reserve and rent food trucks for events.

Depending on the role of the users (owners vs. users) they can undertake specific actions:

- Unregistered users can only view the food truck card without price or availability. 
- Registered users can search and view details of the trucks, as well as create request through a form and pay reservation.
- Registered owners can register food trucks and a presentation profile to offer their services and receive requests.
